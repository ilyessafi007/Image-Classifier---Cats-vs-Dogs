# Image-Classifier---Cats-vs-Dogs
Building image classification models using very little data

In this code, we will present a few simple yet effective methods
that you can use to build a powerful image classifier, using only very few training examples
--just few pictures from each class you want to be able to recognize.

# real-time data augmentation: 
Keras ImageDataGenerator

# dimensionality-reduction technique: 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

# Classification Algorithms: 
-Polynomial SVM

-Random Forest

-XGBOOST
